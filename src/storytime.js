      <i><p />Everything in life is storytelling.
How we think the world works and who we are is a story we tell ourselves because our broken pattern recognizing brains
can't handle genuine chaos.
<p />"Investment Theses" are stories. Art is a story. History is a story. All stories are true, and all stories are lies.</i>
      <p />This is a little bit of our shared history. This is BASED history. This is:

      <h1> Above Average Joe: (or The Unending Tragedy of Being 105 IQ)</h1>
      <h2>Chapter 1: HOPE - August 21, 2020</h2>
      <img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/day1/joseph0.png")} />
      <p />Joseph enters our little based world. We are not ready for the TRUTH that he will bring. He is messianic.
      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/day1/joseph1.png")} />
      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/day1/joseph2.png")} />
      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/day1/joseph3.png")} />
      <p />Joseph is indeed above average. He comes in guns blazing with high confidence predictions.
      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/day1/joseph4.png")} />
      <p />He also uses big words like "rehypothecation". This word, what does it mean? Nobody knows, not even Joe. Especially not us 70 IQs.
      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/day1/joseph10.png")} />
      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/day1/joseph11.png")} />
      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/day1/joseph12.png")} />
      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/day1/joseph13.png")} />
      <p />Joseph is a whale hunter and truth teller. He's teaching us all how to beat the whales at their own game. His wisdom is undeniable. He sounds like he knows the future.
      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/day1/joseph17.png")} />
      <p /> Joseph also has a wife, whom he pleased greatly.
      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/day1/joseph18.png")} />
      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/day1/joseph19.png")} />
      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/day1/joseph20.png")} />
      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/day1/joseph21.png")} />
      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/day1/joseph22.png")} />
      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/day1/joseph23.png")} />
      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/day1/joseph24.png")} />
      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/day1/joseph25.png")} />
      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/day1/joseph26.png")} />
      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/day1/joseph27.png")} />
      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/day1/joseph28.png")} />
      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/day1/joseph29.png")} />
      <p /> This story is one of hope. It is the age old story of a plucky rebel rallying the people and outwitting the oppressors.

      <p />He is not only a gamechanger... He is a game breaker. The system is no match for him.

      <p />He has outsmarted everyone by giving power back to the people. He has many ardent followers.

      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/day1/joseph30.png")} />
      <p /> He also has a very large penis, as all male protaganists in epic tales do.

      <h2>Chapter 2: CONVICTION - August 22, 2020</h2>

      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/day2/joseph36.png")} />
      <p />Joseph is fond of bold predictions.
      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/day2/joseph37.png")} />
      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/day2/joseph38.png")} />
      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/day2/joseph39.png")} />
      <p /> Joseph comes under attack, but our hero is no coward. He will not back down. He stands by his convictions as any hero would. These attacks are baseless and spiteful.
      <p />Fear not. Our hero will be vindicated by the Halving.
      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/day2/joseph40.png")} />
      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/day2/joseph41.png")} />
      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/day2/joseph42.png")} />
      <p />The system stands against him. Hordes of undead seek to damage his credibility, and alas, he is forced backwards into a defensive posture. He bends... but does not break.
      <p />Despite troubles with differentiating probability and game theory, he is undaunted. After all, he may not be a mathmetician, but he is a knower of people.
      <p />He knows this game, and how his foes will act. And so he knows the correct riposte.
      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/day2/joseph43.png")} />
      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/day2/joseph44.png")} />
      <p />His core conviction is still the same. He will not waver from this noblest of paths.
      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/day2/joseph45.png")} />
      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/day2/joseph46.png")} />
      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/day2/joseph47.png")} />
      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/day2/joseph48.png")} />
      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/day2/joseph49.png")} />
      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/day2/joseph50.png")} />
      <p />When the enemy gains ground, you must strike twice as hard.
      <p />Joseph puts his reputation on the line. these predictions may seem outlandish to some, but that is just because these cowards know nothing of what courage is.
      <p />He pities those who don't have the mettle to follow through. Those who aren't willing to fight for what they believe.
      <p />Those poor souls and their weak, shaking hands. They will never know the taste of victory, for they lack the gumption to be truly great.

      <h3>Chapter 3: DOUBT - August 23, 2020</h3>
      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/day3/joseph51.png")} />
      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/day3/joseph52.png")} />

      <p />The crowd has turned against our hero. He has made one too many missteps, and the sentiment has changed.
      <p />He remains undeterred. Also, he learned the word straddle, and bravely used it in a sentence. Nevermind that his usage was incorrect, its the conviction that matters.
      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/day3/joseph53.png")} />
      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/day3/joseph54.png")} />
      <p />Joseph will NOT YIELD (pun not intended). He draws his line in the sand, plants his feet, and dares the universe to knock him down.
      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/day3/joseph55.png")} />
      <p />The attacks come from all sides. From up above...
      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/day3/joseph56.png")} />
      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/day3/joseph57.png")} />
      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/day3/joseph58.png")} />
      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/day3/joseph59.png")} />
      <p />And from the crazed mob below. His credibility is being questioned, but all great men face their fair share of slander.
      <p />He <b>believes</b>, and ultimately that's what counts.
      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/day3/joseph60.png")} />
      <p />The powers that be thwart him at every turn.
      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/day3/joseph61.png")} />
      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/day3/joseph62.png")} />
      <p /> Perhaps the challenge is too great. Our hero is weary. Even those who he thought allies turn against him.
      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/day3/joseph63.png")} />
      <p /> Joseph fights, but his burdens are heavy... Perhaps too heavy for any one man.
      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/day3/joseph63.png")} />

      <h3>Chapter 4: DESPAIR - August 24, 2020</h3>
      <p />His spirit has been broken. This world is far too cruel.

      <p />I will let our fallen hero speak his own words...

      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/day4/joseph64.png")} />
      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/day4/joseph65.png")} />
      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/day4/joseph66.png")} />
      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/day4/joseph67.png")} />
      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/day4/joseph68.png")} />
      <p />His college education has not prepared him for the harsh reality of this BASED game.

      <h3>Chapter 5: DESPAIR - August 25, 2020</h3>

      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/day5/joseph69.png")} />
      <p />For those keeping track... the above is the 69th image in this epic saga.
      <p />It is also when Joseph concedes. Perhaps blind conviction is not enough.
      <p />As he says... The music has stopped. It's a game of musical chairs.
      <p />And he has pulled his own chair out from under himself.
      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/day5/joseph70.png")} />
      <p />And even as he suffers these wounds, he is etched into the fabric of our BASED history.
      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/day5/joseph71.png")} />
      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/day5/joseph72.png")} />
      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/day5/joseph73.png")} />
      <p />He is bitter... and he wishes he had not played such a dangerous game.
      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/day5/joseph74.png")} />
      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/day5/joseph75.png")} />
      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/day5/joseph76.png")} />
      <p />He has lost the game, and so obviously the game is over.
      <p />To survive, we tell stories about ourselves... to ourselves.
      <p />It is game over for Joseph... so the game is over for you too, reader.

      <h3>EPILOGUE </h3>
      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/epilogue/joseph77.png")} />
      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/epilogue/joseph78.png")} />
      <p />Perhaps our hero was no hero at all.
      <p />Merely a slightly above average Joe who managed to lose even in the easiest of games (YFI).
      <p />A tragic figure. This was not an epic. It was a fable.
      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/epilogue/joseph79.png")} />
      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/epilogue/joseph80.png")} />
      <p />But life moves on. Those who have high time preference have things to do after all.
      <p />Wives need to be pleased and (expensive) paint needs to be purchased.
      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/epilogue/joseph81.png")} />
      <p />He writes the game off as a scam. After all, he lost. With a IQ of 105, how could he lose at anything?
      <p />The game was rigged from the start.
      <p /><img alt="" width="500px" src={require("./tragicjoe/epilogue/josephend.png")} />
